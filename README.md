# Projects-Assignment
Analysis and Design of Algorithms


### You have to work on all of the following projects:

Project 1

Implement Kruskal’s Algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted graph (network) and the cost of this MST.

In this project assignment, you will use Kruskal's algorithm, Graphs, Data Structure to write a program for implementing Kruskal’s Algorithm to understand how Kruskal’s algorithm could be applied to find MST and to compute its cost.

The Input: a graph (network) G(V, E) and the edges’ weights

The Output: The MST and the cost of the MST

Project 2

Implement either Insertion Sort or Merge Sort to sort a list of n numbers.

The Input: a set of n unsorted numbers: a1, a2, a3, . . . , an

The Output: the same given n input number but sorted in increasing way.
